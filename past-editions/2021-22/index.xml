These will be augmented with annotated versions, links to recordings, and some short commentary after the fact. If you think you should have access to the recordings but don&amp;rsquo;t, please get in touch.
The long form notes add words in between the bullet points.
Session 1, annotated, video.
We introduced some ideas of computer architecture and talked about the motivation for the course.</description></item><item><title>Coursework: fast finite elements</title><link>https://scicomp-durham.github.io/COMP52315/past-editions/2021-22/coursework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicomp-durham.github.io/COMP52315/past-editions/2021-22/coursework/</guid><description>Fast finite elements # The submission deadline for this work is 2022-02-21 at 14:00UTC. Introduction # The finite element method is a popular and flexible method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In this coursework, you will study and benchmark some performance optimisations for a prototypical finite element problem.
In particular, we will study the solution of the simplest possible finite element problem, to solve the linear system</description></item></channel></rss>
