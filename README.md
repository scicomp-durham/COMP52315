Source repository for
[COMP52315](https://www.dur.ac.uk/postgraduate.modules/module_description/?year=2022&module_code=COMP52315).

Go to
[scicomp-durham.github.io/COMP52315/](https://scicomp-durham.github.io/COMP52315/)
for the hosted material.

The pages can be built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io). For generation of
figures you need the standalone version of
[diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net) as well as a Python environment
with [numpy](https://numpy.org) and
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org). If these are in place, `make html`
builds everything and puts it in `site/public`. In the `site`
subdirectory `hugo server` will launch a local server that autobuilds
the webpages (not figures) on change.

This repository was created by [Lawrence
Mitchell](mailto:lawrence@wence.uk), who maintained the material until
March 2022. The module is currently taught by [Massimiliano
Fasi](mailto:massimiliano.fasi@durham.ac.uk) and [Laura
Morgenstern](mailto:laura.morgenstern@durham.ac.uk).
