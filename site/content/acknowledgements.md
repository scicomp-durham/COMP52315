# Acknowledgements
The course was developed by [Lawrence
Mitchell](mailto:lawrence.mitchell@durham.ac.uk).

Some of the exercises adapt material from the [HPC
group](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/) at
[FAU](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/). Their [likwid
tool](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/) is invaluable.
