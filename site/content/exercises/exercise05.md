# Verifying a model with measurements

The goal of this exercise is to verify our model for the number of
loads and stores in a stream benchmark using performance counters,
accessed via
[`likwid-perfctr`](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/wiki/likwid-perfctr).

## Background

In `code/exercise05/stream.c`, you can find [a C implementation]({{<
code-ref 5 "stream.c" >}}) of the [STREAM
TRIAD](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/) benchmark. The code provides
a scalar, an SSE, and AVX implementations of the loop

```c {linenos=false}
double *a, *b, *c;
...
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
  c[i] = c[i] + a[i] * b[i];
}
```
Once compiled, the program can be called as `./stream <N> <LOOP_TYPE>`,
where `<N>` is the number of elements in the three arrays and
`<LOOP_TYPE>` is one of `sca`, `sse`, `avx`, `fma`, `align`, or
`unalign`. See `./stream -h` (or the source code itself) for more
details on this option.

We will measure the number of loads and stores for this loop using
`likwid-perfctr`. In order to do so, we need to compile the code
appropriately.

## Compiling with likwid annotations enabled

The code is annotated with [likwid-specific
markers](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/wiki/likwid-perfctr#using-the-marker-api)
around the relevant loops. This is to ensure that counters are measured
only for the portions of codes we are interested in profilin We
therefore need to enable these when compiling. As before we load the
likwid module with `module load likwid/5.2.0`.

We can safely compile this code with GCC, load the GCC module with
`module load gcc/12.2` and run:

```
gcc -std=c99 -mfma -O1 -DLIKWID_PERFMON -fno-inline -march=native -o stream stream.c -llikwid
```

The flag `-DLIKWID_PERFMON` adds a new symbol in the
preprocessor which will turn on the likwid markers. We then also need
to link against the likwid runtime library with `-llikwid`.
To ensure that this library is available when you run the code, you
should load the likwid module on the compute node (or run `module
load likwid/5.2.0` in your batch submission script).

For this exercise, `likwid-perfctr` does not give us an appropriate
predefined group. Instead, we must use a low-level counter directly. The
relevant counters are `LS_DISPATCH_LOADS` for loads and
`LS_DISPATCH_STORES` for stores. We must specify a [_group
string_](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/wiki/likwid-perfctr#using-custom-event-sets),
of the form `<counter>:<register>`, where `<counter>` is the performance
counter we want to use (for example `LS_DISPATCH_LOADS`) and
`<register>` is the register in which we want to save it. For memory
operations we can use the registers `PMC0` and `PMC1` (possibly others,
but these will suffice).

A complete command line to measure the number of loads is
```
likwid-perfctr -m -g "LS_DISPATCH_LOADS:PMC0" -C 0 ./stream 1000000 sca
```

This tell `liwid-perfctr` to enable the marker API (with `-m`), to count
the `LS_DISPATCH_LOADS` event in `PMC0`, and to pin the
executable to core zero (with `-C 0`). This final part is necessary so
that the operating system does not move the executable from one core to
another during execution, which would break our measurements. The
command should produce an output like the following:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|  LS_DISPATCH_LOADS  |   PMC0  |      3005392 |
+---------------------+---------+--------------+
```

This measurement at least, aligns with what we expected, since we see
about 3000000 loads.

{{< question >}}
1. How does the number of loads change if you use the SSE, AVX, or FMA
   versions of the code?
2. How many stores do you measure?
