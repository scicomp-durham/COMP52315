# Other reading/resources


- [Travis Downs](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/)
  writes an interesting, and tremendously detailed, low-level
  performance optimisation and measurement blog.
- [John Regehr](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/) writes about
  [compilers](https://blog.regehr.org) often including details of
  optimisation.
- For an interesting look at how far you can go down the rabbithole of
  optimising a small piece of code, see [this sequence of
  posts](https://bits.houmus.org) on improving the performance of
  sorting small arrays by vectorisation (among other things).
- [Denis Bakhvalov](https://easyperf.net) writes a blog on performance
  optimisation, with a focus on the "top-down" methodology. He also
  has a free ebook on performance analysis and tuning, and a [series of
  exercises](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja) exploring
  individual performance analysis and optimisations.
- Andi Kleen develops the
  [`pmu-tools`](https://github.com/andikleen/pmu-tools) project, whose
  `toplev` command is useful. The
  [manual](https://github.com/andikleen/pmu-tools/wiki/toplev-manual)
  has some useful tips.
