Slides that will be used in the lectures. A link to the Panopto
recording, if available, as well as a short summary of what was
discussed, will follow after the session. If you think you should have
access to the recordings but you don't, please [get in
touch]((mailto:massimiliano.fasi@durham.ac.uk)).

The long form notes add words in between the bullet points.
