# Performance models: roofline

If our goal is to improve the performance of some code we should take
a scientific approach. We must first define what we mean by
_performance_. So far, we've talked about floating point throughput
(GFlops/s) or memory bandwidth (GBytes/s). However, these are really
secondary characteristics to the primary metric of performance of a
code:

**How long do I have to wait until I get the answer?**

Therefore, we should not lose sight of the overall target of any
performance optimisation study, which is to _minimise the time to
solution_ for a given code.

Our goal is then to come up with a hypothesis-driven optimisation
cycle. A simple flow diagram is shown below

{{< manfig src="optimisationworkflow.svg"
    width="30%"
    caption="Simplified flow diagram for deciding on next steps when optimising code" >}}

The idea is that we decide that the time to solution is too long, and
must therefore optimise the code. We _profile_ the code to determine
where it spends all (or most) of its time, and then construct a model
that explains that time. With a model in hand, we can make a
prediction about the best optimisation to apply.

{{< hint info >}}
Note that we might not always be able to optimise code such that it
can run any faster. So another goal of using a model is to determine
that our code really is running is fast as we might expect.

That is, if we start from a position of "my code is running too slowly
for my liking", we need to determine if that is due to a bad
implementation, or just [hard
cheese](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hard-tough-cheese).
{{< /hint >}}

This allows us to focus our optimisation efforts where they will be
most effective.

To do this, we need to construct some models, we'll see a number of
approaches in this course, the first one we'll consider is the
[_roofline model_](https://doi.org/10.1145/1498765.1498785). This is a
simple model for loop heavy code.

Go away and read that paper, it's quite approachable. We'll discuss it
in class.

## Roofline model

The roofline model has a simple view of both hardware and software

{{< columns >}}

### Simple view of hardware

{{< manfig src="rooflinecpumodel.svg"
    width="100%" >}}

<--->

### Simple view of software

```c
/* Possibly nested loops */
for (i = 0; i < ...; i++)
 /* Complicated code doing
    - N FLOPs causing
    - B bytes of data transfer */
```

This allows us to characterise the code using a single number, its
_operational intensity_, measured in FLOPs/byte

$$
I_c = \frac{N}{B}
$$

{{< /columns >}}

To this characterisation of the software, we add two numbers that
characterise the hardware

1. The _peak floating point performance_ \\(P_\text{peak}\\) measured
   in FLOPs/s
1. The _peak streaming memory bandwidth_ \\(B_\text{peak}\\) measured
   in bytes/s

Our challenge is then to ask what the limit on the performance of a
piece of code is. We characterise performance by how fast work can be
done, measured in FLOPs/s. The roofline model says that the bottleneck
is either due to

1. execution of work, limited by \\(P_\text{peak}\\),
1. or the data path \\(I_c B_\text{peak}\\).

We therefore arrive at a bound on performance

$$
P_\text{max} = \text{min}(P_\text{peak}, I_c B_\text{peak})
$$

This is the simplest possible form of the roofline model. It is an
_optimistic_ model, everything happens as fast as it possibly can.

### Why "roofline"

Let's draw a sketch of the performance limits to understand

{{< manfig src="rooflinesketch.svg"
    width="70%"
    caption="Sketch of the performance limits for the roofline model" >}}

The achievable performance for _any code_ using this model lies
underneath the pitched "roof" (hence roofline). The broad idea is that
we characterise the hardware once (peak floating point performance,
and peak streaming memory bandwidth) and measure $I_c$ for our code
along with _its_ floating point performance. We can then plot the
performance on a roofline plot, which will give an idea of which
performance optimisations are likely to pay off.

### A simple example

For example, consider three exemplar codes, plotted on a roofline

{{< autofig src="roofline-example-simple.svg"
    width="70%"
    caption="Exemplar roofline plot" >}}

The roofline model suggests that there is not really any room to
improve the implementation of "Code A", it's a memory
bandwidth-limited code and achieving that limit.

"Code B" is also memory bandwidth limited, but is not achieving that
limit, so there is potentially some room for optimisation.

Finally "Code C" is limited by floating point throughput, and is not
close.

This model therefore suggests that we don't need to do anything with
"Code A", we should look at ways of improving the memory traffic for
"Code B", and we should look at ways of improving the floating point
performance of "Code C".

{{< hint warning >}}

One thing you may immediately have spotted is that if we only have a
roofline plot to hand, we can't answer our initial question.

There is no way to know how fast these codes get the answer.

Consequently, we should not use it to judge which of a number of
different algorithms for a given problem are best (since we may be led
to false conclusions).

This is a general rule with optimisation. We start out with lofty goals
of improving runtime, but when we start profiling we look at memory
bandwidth and floating point throughput. It's easy to forget that
we're really wanting to improve runtime.

{{< /hint >}}

### Determining hardware characteristics

To figure out the performance limits of any given hardware, we have
two options:

1. Look up values on a spec sheet
2. Perform some measurements

Recall that we need two pieces of information, the memory bandwidth
and the floating point throughput.

#### Memory bandwidth

To look up the maximum achievable bandwidth on a spec sheet, we need to
know the CPU model, as well as what type of RAM is installed. Let's do
an example with the chips on Hamilton. To determine the installed chip
on a compute node, we can look at the contents of `/proc/cpuinfo`,
looking for the `model name`:

```
$ ssh hamilton
$ srun --pty $SHELL
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | tail -1
model name	: AMD EPYC 7702 64-Core Processor
```

{{< hint info >}}
Whenever you run the likwid tools they will also report the CPU you
were running on.
{{< /hint >}}

With this information, we can go to [wikichip.org](https://wikichip.org)
and search for `EPYC 7702`. The [memory controller
section](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/epyc/7702#Memory_controller)
for the chip page tells us that each of these chips supports 8 channels
with a maximum achievable memory bandwidth of 190.7GB/s.

Although the memory system can in theory deliver this, it is not
achievable by a single core: we'll see this when we measure stuff later.

There are two issues with this:

1. We do not know if Hamilton 8 has DDR3200 RAM chips installed
2. This is a "guaranteed not to exceed" limit which, in practice, is not
   typically achieved even with the right RAM.

The alternative approach, which nearly everyone uses, is to _measure_
the memory bandwidth using the
[STREAM](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/) benchmark. This is what we
will typically do, and [exercise 4]({{< ref "../exercises/exercise04.md"
>}}) does exactly that.

#### Floating point throughput

Again, the guaranteed not to exceed peak can be determined from spec
sheet frequencies and some knowledge of hardware. To do this, let's look
a little at how a CPU core actually works.

{{< hint info >}}
If you want _much_ more details on speed limits of compiled code,
Travis Downs has a really nice
[overview](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2019/06/11/speed-limits.html).
This is article is also a good introduction to lots of the details of
modern CPUs.
{{< /hint >}}

A simplified picture of a CPU execution engine is shown below (for the
Haswell microarchitecture).

{{< manfig src="haswellexec.png"
    width="50%"
    caption="Simplified picture of the Haswell execution engine" >}}

The individual assembly instructions in the compiled code are fetched
and decoded. They are then scheduled (and possibly reordered) in
hardware onto execution ports.

These ports feed the instruction to the execution unit which executes
and retires the instruction.

{{< hint info >}}
Instructions are _issued_ to the scheduler, but may fail to complete
because of data dependencies not being satisfied, or because they were
issued in a mis-predicted branch.

An instruction finally completes (leaving the execution pipeline) when
it is _retired_.
{{< /hint >}}

You can find a detailed description of the floating point unit of
the CPU that equips Hamilton's compute nodes on the [Zen 2 WikiChip
page](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen_2#Floating_Point_Unit).


The processor can issue up to 4 μops (or micro-ops) per cycle. However,
a port in the execution engine can only execute one μop per cycle.
The Zen 2 microarchitecture has 4 ports: additions issue on ports 2 or
3, divisions only issue on port 3, multiplications and fused
multiply-add (FMA) instructions (which perform $y ← a + b\times
c$) on ports 0 and 1.

Therefore our chip can issue at most 2 floating point instructions of
the same type per cycle. But could potentially execute two FMAs while a
division and an addition are taking place.

If our code only executes floating point instructions, then the best
possible case is that we have two SIMD FMA instructions issued per
cycle. In this case, the guaranteed not to exceed peak for a single core
of the Zen 2 chips on Hamilton (which have a peak frequency of 3.35GHz)
is

$$
3.35 \times 2 \times 4 \times 2 = 53.6\text{GFlops/s}
$$

We issue 2 FMAs per cycle, each operates on 4 double-precision numbers
(since a `double` is 64bits and an AVX register is 256bits), so each
instruction does $4\times 2 = 8$ floating point operations.

Conversely, if our code only contains divisions instructions, then the
peak possible performance is only

$$
3.35 \times 1 \times 4 = 13.4\text{GFlops/s}
$$

These calculations are further complicated by [_frequency
scaling_](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/frequency_behavior). For
lots of detail on this, see this [excellent
article](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/01/17/avxfreq1.html).

To actually hit these limits is remarkably difficult. The FMA
instruction has a pipeline latency of 5 on Zen 2 chips, so to hit the
throughput limit, we need 5 in-flight instructions per port, for a total
of 10 in-flight instructions. Feeding enough data to these is very
difficult. The closest that numerical code typically gets to this in is
highly-optimised [dense linear algebra](https://github.com/flame/blis/)
libraries.

It is therefore often useful to do two things:

1. Measure the achievable floating point peak with
   [LINPACK](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-benchmarks-suite.html)
   instead of computing it
2. Add multiple floating point limits on our roofline plot,
   corresponding to different instruction mixes. We will see how we
   can measure, or estimate, the instruction mix in our code later.

### Computing arithmetic intensity

Now that we've characterised our hardware, it's time to move on to the
characterisation of our code. Recall that we need to determine the
_arithmetic intensity_ $I_c$: the number of floating point operations
performed per byte of data accessed.

There are two approaches we can take here

1. Run our code and measure, using performance counters, which we will
   get to later.
2. Read the relevant part of the code and count floating point
   operations and data accesses.

Both approaches have pros and cons, I therefore recommend, if possible
to take a blended approach, augmenting measurements with models.

#### Counting by hand

Let's look at a simple example to see how we would go about counting
floating point operations and data movement.

Consider the following simple loop:

```c
double *a, *b, *c, *d;
...; /* Allocate memory and initialise */

/* This is the code we've determined to do all the floating point work. */
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  a[i] = b[i]*c[i] + d[i]*a[i];
}
```

This code does $N$ iterations of a loop, each iteration performs two
multiplications and one addition for a total of $3N$ double precision
floating point operations.

Notice how in the simplest case, we don't care about the type of
floating point operation.

{{< exercise >}}

Given that there are two multiplications and one addition per loop
iteration, what is the minimum number of cycles required to execute a
single iteration of the loop (ignore any memory load and store
operations).

{{< /exercise >}}

Now let's try and count the data accesses. Each read counts as one
access, each write counts as two (one load, and one store[^1]). We
only care about array data so we should ignore any loop variables.

So our loop performs three double precision reads and one double
precision read-write (`a[i]` appears on both sides) for a total of
$5\times 8$ bytes required per iteration (or $40N$ bytes total).

[^1]: In some cases, they only count as a store, if the compiler can
      use [nontemporal
      stores](https://sites.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2018/01/01/notes-on-non-temporal-aka-streaming-stores/)

This seems like we're now done, in our abstract model, the arithmetic
intensity of our code is

$$
I_c = \frac{3N}{40N} = 0.075 \text{flops/byte}.
$$

There is one remaining wrinkle. Although it is reasonable to count
floating point operations in this manner, to determine the actual data
moved we need a model of the cache behaviour of the hardware.

For the loop we just studied, every entry is touched exactly once and
then discarded (so we just care about streaming the data). Let's look
at an example where this isn't the case.

```c
double *a, *b, *c, *d;
...;

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
    a[j] = b[i]*c[i] + d[i]*a[j];
  }
}
```

In this example, the whole of `a` is touched for every iteration of
the outer loop. Similarly, each entry of `b`, `c`, and `d` is accessed
`j` times in the inner loop. A memory-optimal implementation of this
loop would load `b[i]`, `c[i]`, and `d[i]` into registers for each
iteration of the outer loop and keep all of `a` in cache for the
duration. However, if the cache is not big enough, we might not
achieve this.

### Cache models

In our analysis, we might not have complete knowledge of the cache
sizes, so we can use some simple models. The two extremes are a
_perfect cache_ and a _pessimal cache_.

{{< columns >}}
#### Perfect cache

This model provides a _lower bound_ on data movement. We assume that
each piece of data is moved from main memory exactly once. It
therefore counts _unique_ memory accesses.

For the example above, we touch $M$ entries of `a` with read-write
access (for $8 \times 2 M$ bytes), and we touch $N$ entries each of
`b`, `c`, and `d` with read access (for $8 \times 3 N$ bytes).

So the total data movement for a perfect cache model is $16M + 24N$ bytes.

<--->

#### Pessimal cache

This model provides an _upper bound_ on data movement. We assume that
each access misses cache, and so we count the _total_ non-unique
memory accesses.

For the example above, there are $MN$ iterations of the loops, so the
total data movement for a pessimal cache model is $40 MN$ bytes.

{{< /columns >}}

Real code will fall somewhere in between these two extremes: hopefully
close to the perfect cache case.

We can also come up with intermediate bounds. In the above example,
suppose that `a` does not fit in cache, we would expect that the
streaming access to `b`, `c`, and `d` to be fine (because there's
registere reuse), but we might get no cache hits for `a`. In this case
we might expect that the total data movement is $8 \times 2 MN +
8\times 3 N = 16 MN + 24 N$ bytes. Since we stream the read arrays
only once, but stream `a` $N$ times.

{{< exercise >}}

Suppose $N = 1000$ and $M = 32000$, compute the arithmetic intensities
for the above double loop assuming the perfect and pessimal cache
models, along with our better intermediate estimate.

{{< /exercise >}}

The reason to use these models is that they give us bounds on what is
achievable by a real code. Measurement of arithmetic intensity only
tells us what the code we _have_ does, not what it _could do_.
